### So recently I've taken an interest in the stock market
I've decided that I want to start day trading. As of right now, I have a bit of money that I've saved that I could spend on new shoes or something, but I'd rather see if I can do well at day trading. With (right now) a new stimulus bill potentially around the corner and the stock market on a general uptrend, I think it's a great time to start investing.

### Or is it...?
At first after I had researched into day trading, I started using a trading simulator. I was trading mostly big stocks, like Tesla or Apple and other stocks like that. Call it greed, but I wasn't getting as much profit as I wanted or as much profit as some day traders bragged about. So, I started looking into other options. Low market cap stocks being pretty much the only other option, I started looking into trading those. I started to notice a trend in these low market cap stocks though.

### They're volatile
I mean I know their price can change because their market cap is low but they seemed to change more than they should. After looking into it I noticed that we've had the greatest rises but also some of the greatest losses. In other words, the volatility has increased since the corona virus lock down. So if the stock market is already volatile, low market cap stocks would be even more volatile.
### Why is this happening?
My reasoning is that with everybody stuck at home and new stimulus bill money or just spare money to invest combined with the news about Gamestock's meteoric rise has caused an influx of new traders with new money, adding more randomness to the stock market. Nothing revolutionary, but with all this randomness low market cap stocks are becoming less predictable. When the outcome is left to chance, it might as well be a game or even gambling.
